// Problem 1
const cars = ['Tesla', 'Mercedes', 'Honda']
const [ randomCar ] = cars
const [ ,otherRandomCar ] = cars
//Predict the output
console.log(randomCar)
console.log(otherRandomCar)
//Prediction: Should return Tesla and Mercades because they are the first two in the array

// Problem 2
const employee = {
    name: 'Elon',
    age: 47,
    company: 'Tesla'
}
const { name: otherName } = employee;
//Predict the output
console.log(employee.name);
console.log(otherName);
//Prediciton: Should return as an error because name is under employee

//Problem 3
const person = {
    name: 'Phil Smith',
    age: 47,
    height: '6 feet'
}
const password = '12345';
const { password: hashedPassword } = person;  
//Predict the output
console.log(password);
console.log(hashedPassword);
//Predicton: The hashed Password should return undefined because nothing in the person variable is defined, however password will return 12345

//Problem 4
const numbers = [8, 2, 3, 5, 6, 1, 67, 12, 2];
const [,first] = numbers;
const [,,,second] = numbers;
const [,,,,,,,,third] = numbers;
//Predict the output
console.log(first == second);
console.log(first == third);
//Prediction: One will come back true and one will come back as false

//Problem 5
const lastTest = {
    key: 'value',
    secondKey: [1, 5, 1, 8, 3, 3]
}
const { key } = lastTest;
const { secondKey } = lastTest;
const [ ,willThisWork] = secondKey;
//Predict the output
console.log(key);
console.log(secondKey);
console.log(secondKey[0]);
console.log(willThisWork);
//Prediction: key should come back with 'value', secondkey should back with the whole array, secondkey[0] will come back with the first position, which is 1, and willThisWork returns the second one in the array, which is 5
